## Project Structure

The app hosts multiple portals under path prefixes in a single Next.js instance. When a production domain is available, a middleware layer will rewrite subdomains (`admin.hope.org` → `/admin/...`) transparently.

## Authentication & Security

Authentication is session-based using **HttpOnly cookies**:

- Login submits credentials to `POST /api/auth/login` which sets an `access_token` cookie
- The `ProtectedRoute` component and `UserContext` guard all `/admin/` pages client-side
- The `ProtectedRoute` component wraps all dashboard layouts as a client-side guard
- The Axios instance includes a **response interceptor** that:
  - Catches `401 Unauthorized` responses
  - Attempts a silent token refresh via `POST /api/auth/refresh`
  - Queues concurrent requests during refresh and replays them on success
  - Redirects to `/login` if refresh also fails
- Logout calls `POST /api/auth/logout` to invalidate the session cookie server-side

---

## API Integration

All HTTP communication is handled through a single configured Axios instance in `lib/axios.ts`.

**Base configuration:**
```
Base URL:    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
Credentials: true (sends cookies cross-origin)
```
